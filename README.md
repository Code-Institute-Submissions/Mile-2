# Mile-2 

## Milestone Two Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a proper linkage of APIs which return useful finance information about stock indexes that I’m currently following on a daily basis. 
The project has also a time API linked that gives the current time in New York City, you want to keep track of time in that city, so, you know whether or not you’re still able to place or dispose of a position. The style of the app has not been leading, but I tried to do it as much appealing to the eye as I could. 
In a nut shell, this is my second project. I have to admit that connecting APIs through JavaScript, converting the response through jsons, looping through functions, and using sub-strings to display the wanted part of the API quotation has been the most challenging venture I have experienced so far in the coding world.
 However, I dedicated a serious chunk of time which paid off and I can say, I’m humbly proud of the achieved outcome. I hope that Code Institute officials see it that way as well.

## UX and Design
Mobile first approach has been applied, but please open up the desktop version as well, really like how it looks. As I mentioned above, the style hasn’t been leading, but in my opinion turned out to be very clean and sleek. 
The project tracks the price and volume of three of my favorite securities. Also, displays New York time. The logo of my future brand is presented in the opening tab as well as in the footer.

## Technologies

* HTML- HTML5

* CSS - used for styling purpose 

* [VSCode] ((https://code.visualstudio.com/) – is text editor that I am currently using)

*	[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) – has been used big time to create the desired framework of my web-site

*	[Git & Github](https://github.com/) – for storing and backing up externally 

*	Javascript/Json - APIs are delivered through the fetch method and converted through JSON so they are enabled to be displayed into the HTML 

* [Rapidapi] (https://rapidapi.com/alphavantage/api/alpha-vantage) - this website delivered the stock index APIs. This feature is free of charge, but you have to wait in between refreshing it, too many attempts will result in failure to load (free version)

* [Rapidapi] (https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/world-clock) - this websites gives the time API

* [Microsoft Word] (https://www.office.com/) - this time I did my wireframes in word, have used up all my free acounts of the professional wireframe website
